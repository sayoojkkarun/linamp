# Contributing to Linamp

Thanks for helping! Bug reports, testing on other distributions and pull
requests are all welcome.

## Reporting bugs

Please include:

- distribution, desktop and session type (`echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`)
- `linamp /VERSION` and how you installed it
- steps to reproduce, and what you expected instead
- a log from `RUST_LOG=debug linamp /NEW …` if playback or skins misbehave
- for skin problems, the `.wsz` file (if you are allowed to share it)

## Development setup

Requirements are in the [README](README.md#requirements): Rust 1.89 or
newer and a C compiler. No `-devel` packages are needed.

```sh
cargo build
cargo run -p linamp -- /NEW /INIDIR=/tmp/linamp-dev ~/Music
```

Use `/NEW /INIDIR=<dir>` while developing so you don't touch your real
settings or a running instance.

Useful tools:

```sh
cargo run -p linamp-audio --example play -- --vol 0 file.flac   # engine without UI
cargo run -p linamp-skin --example dump_sheets -- skin.wsz out/  # skin sheets as PNG
LINAMP_SNAPSHOT=out/ cargo run -p linamp -- /NEW /INIDIR=/tmp/x  # windows as PNG, then exit
```

## Before opening a pull request

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

CI runs the same checks, plus a build with the minimum supported Rust
version (1.89).

Guidelines:

- **Scope:** keep changes focused; one logical change per commit, with a
  message that says why.
- **Tests:** add unit tests for parsing, formats and model logic. UI changes
  should come with a before/after `LINAMP_SNAPSHOT` image in the PR.
- **Real-time safety:** don't block the audio thread on locks the UI holds
  for long, and don't do I/O on the UI thread. Use the existing worker
  threads and events.
- **Artwork:** do not add artwork, presets or code from Winamp or other
  proprietary software. The default skin is drawn in code
  (`crates/linamp-skin/src/default_skin.rs`), and third-party skins are
  loaded at runtime, never bundled.
- **Dependencies:** must be compatible with MIT OR Apache-2.0 distribution.
  Prefer crates that don't need system `-devel` packages at build time.
